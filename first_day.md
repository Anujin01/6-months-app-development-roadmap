# App Development

I installed **Node.js** to build my app. Instead of using only JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js allows me to create a backend and manage resources more efficiently.

Node.js comes with a package manager called **npm** (Node Package Manager), which is used to install and manage software packages written in JavaScript.
